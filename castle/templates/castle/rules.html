    <h1>Ficlatt&eacute; rules</h1>
    <p>Respect each other, please.  We are a community that writes stories, and stories are what unite us and excite us.  Some of our stories are better than others, and it's our job to help each other get better.  It is fine to rate a story low but, if you do, be sure to leave a good comment about why you feel that it deserves a low rating.  Criticise the writing, not the writer.</p>
    
    <p>If your story contains descriptions of violent acts or is somewhat sexy, mark it as mature.</p>
    
    <p>You will need to enter an e-mail address on the registration page.  When you sign up, we will send you an e-mail to that address containing a link that you will need to click to confirm the address.  Once you have confirmed your address, you will be able to write stories and comments on the site</p>
    
    <h4>A note about cookies</h4>
    <p>The site leaves a cookie on your browser when you log in.  If you don't want the cookie, don't log in.  This means that you won't be able to post stories or comments, but that's the decision you make</p>
    
    <h4>In conclusion</h4>
    <p>Go out there and be awesome</p>

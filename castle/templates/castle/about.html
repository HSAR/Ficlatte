    <h1>About Ficlatté</h1>

    <p class="about"><strong>What is Ficlatté?</strong></p>

    <p class="about">Ficly is about creativity. It's about looking for a way to allow anyone to carve out fifteen minutes to create and
    write, whether that's to continue a story someone else has started or to start something new of their own, with
    just two or three paragraphs and a simple idea.</p>

    <p class="about">That’s the basic premise. We impose a limit of 1,024 characters because sometimes constraints are good. They
        force you choose your words more carefully, to make the maximum impact with a minimum of syllables. They also
        make it less daunting to write than it might be if you were staring at a never-ending blank screen in a word
        processor. All you have to do is write one kilobyte of something – something fictional. That's it. That’s all.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><strong>The Story of Ficlatté</strong></p>

    <p class="about">Ficlatté is the third-generation of a micro-fiction website that began nearly a decade ago with
        <strong>ficlets</strong>, the experimental brain-child of AOL, helmed by Kevin Lawver and Jason Garber.
        ficlets lived for 18 months and gathered a community that generated over 45,000 individual entries. Then AOL
        mothballed the project and moved on to other things.</p>

    <p class="about">Fortunately Kevin and Jason weren't content to leave it at that. In 2009 they built the successor
        to ficlets, called <a href="http://ficly.com">Ficly</a> and breathed new life into what ficlets began. Many members
        of the ficlets community migrated to Ficly, and over the next five years, the community grew again into a vibrant
        hive of creativity and imagination.</p>

    <p  class="about">But alas even Ficly was ultimately forced to close its doors and the community was once again
        temporarily homeless. But they didn't have to wait long or go far. In 2015 Paul Robertson launched the first
        version of Ficlatté and got the skeleton of a new castle off the ground. Many members of Ficly's community
        found their way here; many others got lost along the way. But over the last several years, we've slowly been developing
        this barebones castle into a fully-featured fortress, and the stories being told around the various hearths
        within these walls have kept us warm during many a cold night. We hope Ficlatté will outlast both ficlets and Ficly
        combined, and we continue to construct new rooms, corridors, and secret passageways throughout the castle with
        that hope in mind.</p>

    <p  class="about">We hope you'll join us. For most of us here, this is a kind of surrogate family, a home away
        from home, if you will, where the stories are always fresh, the coffee is always hot, and the companionship
        and camaraderie are always warm and welcoming.</p>

    <p  class="about"><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>

    <p  class="about">Ultimately, Ficlatté is made up of everyone who spends time here -- writing, creating, critiquing, and
        commenting. Without our community, this place could not be what it is.</p>

    <p  class="about">However, our current development team is comprised of three individuals:</p>

        <ul class="about">
            <li>Paul Robertson - <a href="http://twitter.com/ficlatte">@ficlatte</a> - dev-at-ficlatte.com</li>
            <li><a href="http://jimstitzel.com">Jim Stitzel</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/stitzelj">@stitzelj</a> -
             jimstitzel-at-gmail.com</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/HSAR">Shu Sam Chen</a></li>
        </ul>

    <p class="about">In addition, we'd like to acknowledge the following people, companies, and resources without
        which our castle would be little more than a pile of stone blocks lying in a field:</p>

        <ul class="about">
            <li><a href="https://ficlatte.com/authors/dkscully/">dkscully</a> for the original site design and layout
            that got us off the ground.</li>
            <li><a href="http://CreateSigns.com">CreateSigns.com</a> for the lovely new logo that now adorns our gates.</li>
            <li>And of course the various open source projects that we've borrowed from in part or in whole to give
            you more ways to keep writing:</li>
                <ul class="repos">
                    <li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://github.com/maaku/django-bbcode">Django-bbcode</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/smalot/bootstrap-datetimepicker">bootstrap-datetimepicker</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/arneb/django-messages">django-messages</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.pixeden.com/">Pixeden</a></li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

    <p class="about">And we're not done building. If anything, we're just beginning. So stick around, grab a hot cup o'
    joe, and keep writing!</p>
